# AddressBook

AddressBook is a basic console application written and tested in Ruby/Rspec. To run it, simply run AddressBook.rb on your machine with Ruby installed!

## What does it do?

AddressBook is like the contacts app on your phone. You can store entries with your contact's name, phone number, and e-mail, and you can then retrieve them by flipping through all of your entries or by searching for the one you want.
